# Chai-Taste-Prediction-App
An ANN trained model which predicts if your tea tastes good or not simply by taking inputs on what ingredients and their quantities are there in it
model trained by ANN sequence
run the app through my streamlit!!
the csv datasheet was pretty small so some obvious mistakes could be seen in the predictions
*THERE MAY BE SOME ERROR ON THE STREAMLIT WEB, YOU CAN RUN TRY THE CODE ON YOUR LOCAL COMPILER IF YOU HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED*
